## application

An _application_ is a group of k8s resources related by
some common purpose, e.g.  a load balancer in front of a
webserver backed by a database.
[Resource] labelling, naming and metadata schemes have
historically served to group resources together for
collective operations like _list_ and _remove_.

This [proposal] describes a new k8s resource called
_application_ to more formally describe this idea and
provide support for application-level operations and
dashboards.

[kustomize] configures k8s resources, and the proposed
application resource is just another resource.

## apply

* == kubectl command / mutate a cluster
* == k8s' foundation of level-based state management 

## base

* == [kustomization] / referred to by some OTHER [kustomization]
  * _Example:_ kustomization / includes an [overlay]

## bespoke configuration

A _bespoke_ configuration is a [kustomization] and some
[resources] created and maintained internally by some
organization for their own purposes.

The [workflow] associated with a _bespoke_ config is
simpler than the workflow associated with an
[off-the-shelf] config, because there's no notion of
periodically capturing someone else's upgrades to the
[off-the-shelf] config.

## custom resource definition

One can extend the k8s API by making a
Custom Resource Definition ([CRD spec]).

This defines a custom [resource] (CD), an entirely
new resource that can be used alongside _native_
resources like ConfigMaps, Deployments, etc.

Kustomize can customize a CD, but to do so
kustomize must also be given the corresponding CRD
so that it can interpret the structure correctly.

## declarative application management

Kustomize aspires to support [Declarative Application Management],
a set of best practices around managing k8s clusters.

In brief, kustomize should

* Work with any configuration, be it bespoke,
   off-the-shelf, stateless, stateful, etc.
* Support common customizations, and creation of
   [variants] (e.g. _development_ vs.
   _staging_ vs. _production_).
* Expose and teach native k8s APIs, rather than
   hide them.
* Add no friction to version control integration to
   support reviews and audit trails.
* Compose with other tools in a unix sense.
* Eschew crossing the line into templating, domain
   specific languages, etc., frustrating the other
   goals.

## generator

* == generator -- of -- NEW resources to create

## gitops

Devops or CICD workflows that use a git repository as a
single source of truth and take action (e.g., build,
test or deploy) when that truth changes.

## kustomization == `kustomization.yaml` 

* ways to share it
  * `kustomization.yaml`,
  * tarball / contains the YAML + references
  * git archive (ditto)
  * URL -- to a -- git repo

* 's [fields](fields.md)
  * categories
    * [resources](#resource) 
      * _Example:_ resources, crds
    * [generators](#generator)
      * _Example:_ configMapGenerator(legacy), secretGenerator(legacy), generators (v2.1).
    * [transformers](#transformer)
      * _Example fields:_ _namePrefix_, _nameSuffix_, _images_,
         _commonLabels_, _patchesJson6902_, etc., _transformers_ (v2.1)
    * meta
      * == fields / -- may influence -- ALL or SOME PREVIOUS ones
      * _Example:_ _vars_, _namespace_, _apiVersion_, _kind_, etc.

## kustomization root

* := directory / IMMEDIATELY contains a `kustomization.yaml` + ALL relative files

* data files
  * must be | kustomization root
  * _Example of data files:_ 
    * resource YAML files,
    * text files / contain _name=value_ pairs -- for a -- ConfigMap or Secret, 
    * files / used | patch transformation
  * -- are specified via -- relative paths

* `--load_restrictions none`
  * == special flag /
    * relax this security feature
    * enable a patch file -- to be shared by -- >1 kustomization

* ways to refer OTHER kustomizations
  * absolute path
  * relative path

* if kustomization __A__ -- depends on -- kustomization __B__ ->
  * ❌ __B__ may NOT _contain_ __A__ ❌
  * ❌__B__ may NOT _depend on_ __A__ ❌

* if __A__ contains __B__ -> recommended to
  * __A__ -- directly depends on -- __B__'s resources
  * eliminate __B__'s "kustomization.yaml"
    * == absorb __B__ | __A__

* COMMON layout

## kubernetes

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) is an open-source
system for automating deployment, scaling, and
management of containerized applications.

It's often abbreviated as _k8s_.

## kubernetes-style object

[fields required]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/kubernetes-objects/#required-fields

An object, expressed in a YAML or JSON file, with the
[fields required] by kubernetes.  Basically just a
_kind_ field to identify the type, a _metadata/name_
field to identify the particular instance, and an
_apiVersion_ field to identify the version (if there's
more than one version).

## kustomize

* == CL tool / 
  * support
    * template-free,
    * declarative configuration / 
      * structured customization 
      * -- target to -- k8s-style objects
        * == understand API resources

* == [DAM]'s implementation 

## off-the-shelf configuration

An _off-the-shelf_ configuration is a kustomization and
resources intentionally published somewhere for others
to use.

E.g. one might create a github repository like this:

> ```
> github.com/username/someapp/
>   kustomization.yaml
>   deployment.yaml
>   configmap.yaml
>   README.md
> ```

Someone could then _fork_ this repo (on github) and
_clone_ their fork to their local disk for
customization.

This clone could act as a [base] for the user's
own [overlays] to do further customization.

## overlay

* := kustomization / -- depends on -- ANOTHER kustomization
* requirements
  * ⚠️its bases ⚠️
    * OTHERWISE, it's unusable 
* use cases
  * \>1 overlays
    * Reason: 🧠create base's DIFFERENT [variants] 🧠
    * _Example:_ _development_, _QA_, _staging_ and
_production_ environment variants
* _Example:_ configures a cluster
    ```
    kustomize build someapp/overlays/staging |\
      kubectl apply -f -
    kustomize build someapp/overlays/production |\
      kubectl apply -f -
    ```
  * implicitly use the base

## package

The word _package_ has no meaning in kustomize, as
kustomize is not to be confused with a package
management tool in the tradition of, say, [apt] or
[rpm].

## patch

General instructions to modify a resource.

There are two alternative techniques with similar
power but different notation - the
[strategic merge patch](#patchstrategicmerge)
and the [JSON patch](#patchjson6902).

## patchStrategicMerge

A _patchStrategicMerge_ is [strategic-merge]-style patch (SMP).

An SMP looks like an incomplete YAML specification of
a k8s resource.  The SMP includes `TypeMeta`
fields to establish the group/version/kind/name of the
[resource] to patch, then just enough remaining fields
to step into a nested structure to specify a new field
value, e.g. an image tag.

By default, an SMP _replaces_ values.  This is
usually desired when the target value is a simple
string, but may not be desired when the target
value is a list.

To change this
default behavior, add a _directive_.  Recognized
directives in YAML patches are _replace_ (the default)
and _delete_ (see [these notes][strategic-merge]).

Note that for custom resources, SMPs are treated as
[json merge patches][JSONMergePatch].

Fun fact - any resource file can be used as
an SMP, overwriting matching fields in another
resource with the same group/version/kind/name,
but leaving all other fields as they were.

TODO(monopole): add ptr to example.

## patchJson6902

A _patchJson6902_ refers to a kubernetes [resource] and
a [JSONPatch] specifying how to change the resource.

A _patchJson6902_ can do almost everything a
_patchStrategicMerge_ can do, but with a briefer
syntax.  See this [example][patchExampleJson6902].

## plugin

A chunk of code used by kustomize, but not necessarily
compiled into kustomize, to generate and/or transform a
kubernetes resource as part of a kustomization.

Details [here](../../../guides/extending_kustomize).

## resource

* | REST-ful API,
  * == HTTP operation's target object

* | kustomization,
  * == [root] relative path -- to a -- [YAML] OR [JSON] / describe a k8s API object

## root

* [kustomization root][root]

## sub-target / sub-application / sub-package

A _sub-whatever_ is not a thing. There are only
[bases] and [overlays].

## target

* == `kustomize build`'s argument
    > ```
    >  kustomize build $target
    > ```
* ALLOWED
  * values
    * [base] 
    * [overlay]
  * types 
    * path -- to a -- [kustomization]
    * url -- to a -- [kustomization]

## transformer

* allows
  * modifying a resource
  * visiting a resource
  * collecting information about the resource | `kustomize build`

## variant

A _variant_ is the outcome, in a cluster, of applying
an [overlay] to a [base].

E.g., a _staging_ and _production_ overlay both modify
some common base to create distinct variants.

The _staging_ variant is the set of resources exposed
to quality assurance testing, or to some external users
who'd like to see what the next version of production
will look like.

The _production_ variant is the set of resources
exposed to production traffic, and thus may employ
deployments with a large number of replicas and higher
cpu and memory requests.
